## Overview

### Description

ModernStoic is a mobile app designed to integrate the principles of Stoic philosophy into daily life. It features interactive journaling, daily quotes from Stoic texts, and information about Stoic philosophers and virtues. Users can also take quizzes to identify which Stoic virtues they may lack and design daily routines based on Stoic principles. The app translates ancient Stoic wisdom into modern contexts, providing users with actionable insights and recommendations for books on Stoicism.
